* Returns: {string}

Sometimes it can be necessary to run some code inside of the same global scope
that the application will run in. This hook allows to return a string that will
be ran as sloppy-mode script on startup.

Similar to how CommonJS wrappers work, the code runs in an implicit function
scope. The only argument is a `require`-like function that can be used to load
builtins like "fs": `getBuiltin(request: string)`.

If the code needs more advanced `require` features, it will have to construct
its own `require` using  `module.createRequire()`.

```js
/**
 * @returns {string} Code to run before application startup
 */
export function getGlobalPreloadCode() {
  return `\
globalThis.someInjectedProperty = 42;
console.log('I just set some globals!');

const { createRequire } = getBuiltin('module');

const require = createRequire(process.cwd() + '/<preload>');
// [...]
`;
}
```
